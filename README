# Cache Test

http://github.com/ferblape/cache_test

A plugin for testing generation and expiration of action cache and fragment cached. Based on http://blog.cosinux.org/pages/page-cache-test


## Example of usage

You can use all the new asserts in functional tests, in this way:

    assert_cache_fragment({:fragment => 'total_posts'}) do
      get :index, :user_id => users(:first)
      assert_response :success
    end


## List of asserts

### Testing action cache

### Testing fragment cache


## About

This plugin is inspired by (cache_test)[http://blog.cosinux.org/pages/page-cache-test], a great plugin that allowed you to test cache in Rails 1.x. 

It was so useful for me that I decided to upgrade it to Rails 2.x and add some tests. 

The test suite was extracted from the test suit of (shoulda)[http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda], another great plugin.
